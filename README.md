# R2 Machine Learning ## Playing with Data [Live version here!](http://r2-ml/)  R2 Machine Learning is an educational sandbox for beginners learning fundamental machine learning principles from scratch, or for those who want to understand ML models from a more intuitive perspective.  We currently support 5 models - KNN, Perceptron, SVMs, neural networks, and Decision Trees.   Feel free to contribute to the project - whether itâ€™s in terms of explanations or adding new models.
